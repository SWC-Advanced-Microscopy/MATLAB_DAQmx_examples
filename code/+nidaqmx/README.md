# NI DAQmx via .NET Wrapper

For more information getting started with the .NET assembly and to see example code:

https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-daqmx-.net-framework-4.5.1-class-library-getting-started/page/netdaqmxmain.html

There is a [list of examples](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/ni-daqmx-.net-framework-4.5.1-class-library-getting-started/page/netdaqmxexamples.html) which you can access locally. 
The easiest approach is to load the VB example (in VisualStudio).
Expand the MainForm.vb in the left panel. 
Double-click on the "MainForm" and you should see the code. 
Even you don't speak VB you ought to be able to make sense of it, especially if you cross-reference with existing MATLAB examples in this folder.
